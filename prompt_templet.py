Solve the following task carefully.
First identify the important information, then work through the
solution logically, and finally provide a concise final answer.
Do not reveal private/internal chain-of-thought. Provide only a
short explanation of the key steps.

Task:
{task}
""".strip()

    if technique == "Manual CoT":
        return f"""
Use the following explicit reasoning structure.

Step 1 - Understand the task:
Identify what is being asked.

Step 2 - Identify information:
List the important facts, inputs, or constraints.

Step 3 - Apply the method:
Describe the main calculation, rule, or approach.

Step 4 - Verify:
Check whether the result is reasonable.

Step 5 - Final answer:
Give the final answer clearly.

Task:
{task}
""".strip()

    if technique == "ToT":
        return f"""
Solve the task by exploring multiple possible approaches.

Approach A:
Suggest one possible solution and briefly evaluate it.

Approach B:
Suggest a second possible solution and briefly evaluate it.

Approach C:
Suggest a third possible solution when useful.

Selection:
Compare the approaches and select the most suitable one.

Final answer:
Provide the selected answer with a concise explanation.

Do not reveal private/internal chain-of-thought.
